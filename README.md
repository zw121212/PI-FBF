A Normalizing Flow-based Bayesian Filtering Method with Physical Information

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation for the paper:
“A Normalizing Flow-based Bayesian Filtering Method with Physical Information”
The code implements a normalizing-flow-based Bayesian filtering framework for sequential state inference under sparse/noisy observations, and supports injecting physical information (e.g., equation residual constraints) to improve long-horizon stability and uncertainty estimation.

Environment:

Python: 3.10
PyTorch: 2.5.1
